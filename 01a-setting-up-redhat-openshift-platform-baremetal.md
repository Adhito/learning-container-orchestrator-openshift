# Project Learning CRC On Baremetal Machine

### **Stage 1: Introduction to Code Ready Container (CRC)**
**Sub-Stage 1.1: Differences between CRC and OCP**

- Please do note that the OpenShift Container Platform cluster is ephemeral 
- The CRC will use single node which behaves as both a control plane and worker node.
- The cluster uses the  **172**  address range. This can cause issues when, for example, a proxy is run in the same address space.
